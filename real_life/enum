What is enum?
enum stands for enumeration.

It is a user-defined type consisting of a set of named integer constants.

It helps make your code more readable by replacing magic numbers with descriptive names.

How does enum work?
When you write:

cpp
Copy
Edit
enum State { GREEN, YELLOW, RED };
You create a new type called State.

The possible values of this type are GREEN, YELLOW, and RED.

By default, GREEN = 0, YELLOW = 1, RED = 2.

You can use these names instead of numbers to improve clarity.

Example in your traffic light code:
cpp
Copy
Edit
State state = GREEN;
means the current state is green (internally represented by 0).

Later, you can do:

cpp
Copy
Edit
state = YELLOW;
to change the state to yellow (internally 1).

This is easier to understand than using state = 0 or state = 1.
