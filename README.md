# TheoryOfComputation üìò (C++ Only)

A curated set of C++ implementations for core concepts in the **Theory of Computation** ‚Äî from DFA/NFA to Turing Machines and grammar parsing.  
Developed and maintained by **Sakiba Belal**, a Software Engineering student at NSTU.

Setup & Compilation
You‚Äôll need:

A C++ compiler (e.g. g++, clang++)

A terminal or IDE like Code::Blocks / VS Code with g++ support

To compile any file:

g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
Example:

g++ dfa_nfa/dfa_simulator.cpp -o dfa
./dfa
Usage Examples
Simulate a DFA:

g++ dfa_nfa/dfa_simulator.cpp -o dfa
./dfa
Convert Regex to NFA:


g++ regex/regex_to_nfa.cpp -o regex
./regex
Run Turing Machine:

g++ tm/tm_simulator.cpp -o tm
./tm
